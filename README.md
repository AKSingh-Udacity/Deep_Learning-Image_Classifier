# Deep_Learning-Image_Classifier

In this project, I trained an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. You can imagine using something like 
this in a phone app that tells you the name of the flower your camera is looking at. We'll be using [this dataset](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html)
of 102 flower categories. 

## Getting Started

This project is informational and does not require you to run any code. This project is meant to display the analysis I conducted on 
the data I gathered.
